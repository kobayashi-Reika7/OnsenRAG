Sulfur springs in Sengokuhara and around Owakudani are said to help chronic skin conditions and atopic dermatitis and have strong antibacterial properties. Chloride springs found in Gora and Miyanoshita have high heat retention and are slow to cool, making them suitable for those with cold sensitivity.
