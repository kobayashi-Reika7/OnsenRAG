Approximately 4,000 liters of hot spring water gush out every minute, and the rising steam is spectacular. Hot water flows slowly through the wooden conduits in the center of the Yubatake, cooling the water temperature from over 50°C before being distributed to various facilities. As the water flows through the conduits, hot spring minerals precipitate to form \"yunohana\" (hot spring crystals). The distinctive emerald green color of the Yubatake is caused by \"Ideyukogome,\" a type of algae that thrives in acidic hot springs. Lighting is displayed from sunset until midnight, offering a fantastical night view with ever-changing colors. The surrounding area features the foot bath \"Yukemuri-tei\" and \"Tearainoyu,\" where you can wash your hands with sterilizing hot spring water."

The spring quality is strongly acidic at around pH 2, with sterilizing properties; it is said to be effective for skin diseases, cuts, burns, and more, and has long been said to \"cure everything except lovesickness.\" Hayashi Razan is said to have selected Arima, Gero, and Kusatsu as \"Japan's Three Famous Hot Springs,\" and in the Edo period, the water was transported to the Tokugawa shogunate as \"offering water.\" In the Meiji period, the German physician Dr. Baelz visited Kusatsu Onsen, proved its medical effectiveness, and introduced it to the world as \"a world-class hot spring health resort.\" Kusatsu Onsen has over 100 hot spring sources in total, and six major sources (Yubatake, Sainokawara, Jizo, Niekawa, Shirahata, and Bandai) supply the hot spring town."

It softens the water and also serves as a warm-up for bathing. The Yubatake is the symbol of Kusatsu Onsen, a hot spring source located in the center of town; hot water flows slowly through wooden conduits to cool the temperature from over 50°C before distributing it to various facilities. Awase-yu is Kusatsu's unique bathing method of bathing in tubs of different temperatures in order from lukewarm to hot, designed to promote blood circulation while minimizing strain on the body and to maximize the effects of the hot spring. Efficacy is expected in various areas including blood circulation promotion, fatigue recovery, and rheumatism improvement."
