Japan has many volcanoes, so hot spring resorts exist throughout the country. There are several types of spring quality, each with different characteristics. Simple hot springs have low stimulation and are suitable for children and the elderly, ideal for long baths and less prone to causing bath fatigue. Sulfur springs have a distinctive sulfur odor and are said to be good for skin conditions and cold sensitivity, but they are highly stimulating so caution is needed with long baths. Bicarbonate springs make it easier to remove dead skin cells and are often called \"beauty skin springs\"; after bathing, skin is said to feel smooth. Chloride springs have high heat-retention effects and are slow to cool down, making them suitable for those with cold sensitivity."},{"chunk_id":"onsen_knowledge_002","section":"Kusatsu Onsen Overview and Spring Quality","metadata":{"source":"onsen_knowledge.txt","category":["Basic Onsen Knowledge"],"area":["Kusatsu Onsen"],"tags":["Kusatsu Onsen","Japan's Three Famous Springs","acid spring","yu-momi","awase-yu"],"priority":3},"content":"Kusatsu Onsen is located in Gunma Prefecture and is one of Japan's Three Famous Springs, boasting the highest natural spring output in Japan.

Bicarbonate springs leave skin feeling refreshed after bathing, making them suitable for summer. In autumn, open-air baths with autumn foliage are exceptional, especially at dusk when the sky and leaves create a fantastical view.

Simple hot springs have low stimulation and allow long bathing; they are ideal for onsen beginners, children, the elderly, and those with sensitive skin, with efficacy for fatigue recovery, neuralgia, and insomnia. Sulfur springs have strong antibacterial effects and suit those with chronic skin conditions, atopic dermatitis, or acne, but they are highly stimulating so those with sensitive skin should take care. Bicarbonate springs are called \"beauty skin springs\" and smooth the skin; they are recommended for those interested in beauty or with dry skin. Chloride springs have high heat-retention effects and are especially suited for those with cold sensitivity or who get cold easily in winter. Acid springs have very strong antibacterial effects and are effective for athlete's foot and chronic dermatitis, but they are highly stimulating to the skin, so rinsing with plain water after bathing is recommended. Radioactive springs (radium springs) are said to boost natural healing and are used for those with gout, rheumatism, or chronic digestive disorders. Choosing the right spring quality for your purpose can maximize the benefits of onsen."}]
